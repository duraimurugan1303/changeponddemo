-- 10.1 Join table PEOPLE and ADDRESS, but keep only one address information for each person (we don't mind which record we take for each person). 
 i.e., the joined table should have the same number of rows as table PEOPLE
 	SELECT P.id, P.name, DISTINCT A.address
	FROM PEOPLE P
	JOIN ADDRESS A ON P.id = A.id;

-- 10.2 Join table PEOPLE and ADDRESS, but ONLY keep the LATEST address information for each person. 
 i.e., the joined table should have the same number of rows as table PEOPLE
	SELECT P.id, P.name, A.address
	FROM PEOPLE P
	JOIN (SELECT id, MAX(updatedate) AS latest_date
	 FROM ADDRESS
    	GROUP BY id) latest ON P.id = latest.id
	JOIN ADDRESS A ON latest.id = A.id AND latest.latest_date = A.updatedate;
